Snake is a classic game, which I learned to develop my logic to make the game without the artificial intelligence doing it. As I said, it's to improve my logic to do it. I'm doing this project using basic technologies.

The game has scores and buttons for the game.

nota:
I also used sprites for the fruit and the snake, the complicated thing for me was integrating the snake sprites because there is only one and I was lazy to separate them.
